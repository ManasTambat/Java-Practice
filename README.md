### Roadmap
1. Syntax and Semantics:
    * [ ] Data Types (The 8 Java Primitive Types)
    * [ ] Variables (The var keyword)
    * [ ] Type Conversion & Casting
    * [ ] Automatic Type Promotion
    * [ ] Arrays
    * [ ] Operators in Java (Arithmetic, Bitwise, Relational, Boolean Logical, Assignment, ? Operator, Operator Precedence)
    * [ ] Control Statements in Java (If, If-Else, If-Else-If, Switch (new and old))
    * [ ] Iteration Statements (While, Do-While, For, For-Each, Nested Loops) [continue, break and labels]
    * [ ] Using Command-Line Arguments in a Java Program
    * [ ] The String class
    * [ ] Varargs [Variable Length Arguments]
    * [ ] Scanner Class, BufferedReader Class
2. Object-Oriented Programming:
    * [ ] Types of Program Units in Java [4 - Class, Abstract Class, Interface, Enum + 1 Record]
    * [ ] Declaring and Using Objects in Methods
    * [ ] Reference Types and Values
    * [ ] Methods (method signature, method types)
    * [ ] Constructors
    * [ ] The this keyword
    * [ ] Overloading Methods
    * [ ] Overloading Constructors
    * [ ] Using Objects (Reference Types) as method parameters and arguments
    * [ ] Using Objects (Reference Types) as return types of methods
    * [ ] Recursion in Java (Call Stack, Tail-Recursion, Head-Recursion)
    * [ ] The static keyword (creating static members in a class)
    * [ ] The final keyword (with a class, with a method, with a member variable of a class)
    * [ ] Nested Classes and Inner Classes
    * [ ] Inheritance in Java (Super & subclasses) [Hierarchies in programs]
    * [ ] The super keyword (calling Super class' members from the subclass)
    * [ ] Types of Hierarchies in Java [Simple, Multi-level, Multiple, Hybrid]
    * [ ] Method Overriding
    * [ ] Abstract Classes and Abstract Members
    * [ ] Interfacing (defining an interface, implementing an interface, nested interfaces, members in an interface, private OR static OR default methods)
    * [ ] Packages in a Java program (CLASSPATH, importing)
    * [ ] Exception Handling (exception types, caught and uncaught exceptions, try-catch, try-finally, try-catch-finally, multiple catch blocks, nested try statements, throw and throws keyword, custom exceptions)
    * [ ] Multithreaded Programming (Java Thread Model, Main Thread, Creating a Thread, Thread class and Runnable interface, multiple threads, sleep() method, thread priorities, using lambda to create a thread, using anonymous class to create a thread)
    * [ ] Enumeration Classes in Java
    * [ ] Type Wrappers (Wrapper Classes in Java)
    * [ ] Boxing and Unboxing
    * [ ] Annotations in Java
    * [ ] Generics in Java (Bounded Types, Wildcard Types, Bounded Wildcards, generic methods, generic constructors, generics with static methods, generic classes, generic interfaces, overloading and overriding in generic methods, Type Erasure, generic arrays)
    * [ ] Lambda Expression (functional interfaces, lambda as arguments, method references)
    * [ ] Stream API (types of methods, common methods from the API)
    * [ ] String Handling (String class constructors, string length, string operations, character extraction, string comparison, searching strings, modifying strings, StringBuilder, StringBuffer)
    * [ ] Classes in the java.lang package
3. Data Structures & Algorithms:
    * [ ] Collections Framework in Java (collection interfaces - List, Set, Deque, collection classes, - ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, PriorityQueue, ArrayDeque, using iterators on collections, Iterator class, for-each loop, streams, Custom Collections Classes, Map Interfaces and Map Classes, Vector, Stack, Dictionary, Hashtable, Properties)
    * [ ] Misc - StringTokenizer, BitSet, Optional, LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime, GregorianCalendar, TimeZone, Locale, Random, Timer, Currency, NumberFormat, StringFormat.
4. Problem Solving:
    * [ ] Hackerrank
